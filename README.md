# Hybrid-Stock-Recommendation-Engine
This project combines **technical analysis**, **data engineering**, and **machine learning** to recommend stocks for intraday or swing trades on Indian markets.

## ðŸ”§ Features
-  Fetches historical and intraday data using `yfinance` and NSE pre-market data
-  Multi-model strategy: Rule-Based + ML (LSTM & RF)
-  Rule-based logic using RSI, Bollinger Bands, Keltner Channels, ATR, MFI, and CCI
-  LSTM model trained on historical sequences to classify: `Buy`, `Sell`, `Hold`
-  Hybrid Decision Engine: Uses ML model only if confidence > 75%, else rule-based logic prevails
-  Outputs clear trading signals with entry, exit, stop-loss, and strategy rationale
-  Signals: Buy, Sell, Hold + Confidence %
-  Computes Entry, Exit (0.5/1/2%) and Stop-Loss

## ðŸ§ª Tech Stack
- **Data Engineering**: `pandas`, `yfinance`, `requests`, time zone handling
- **ML/AI**: `scikit-learn`, `keras`, `tensorflow`, `LSTM`, `LabelEncoder`
- **Rule-Based System**: `ta` indicators, logic-based decision tree
